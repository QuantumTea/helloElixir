# HelloElixir

Learning project. 
Starts with some mathematics, a little date and time work, then moving on to REST endpoint data collection and processing, and some basic authentication using HTTPotion and the Ravelry API.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `helloElixir` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:helloElixir, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `helloElixir` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:helloElixir]]
    end
    ```
